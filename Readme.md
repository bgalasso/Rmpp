# Rmmp guide 

The Rmpp package implements Bayesian semiparametric inferences for modelling, fitting, and registering multiple point processes subject to phase-variation. The main function in the package is the `bmpp` function which is given by  
```
bmpp(xw, support = 1, grid = seq(0, 1, length = 2^8), prior, mcmc, parallel = TRUE)
```
This function implements the model developed in Galasso et al (2022, Electronic Journal of Statistics). Some comments on how to use this  function are in order. First, multiple point process data should be given in a list whose entries correspond to a single point process; for example let's simulate some data according to the latter structure: 
```
# Simulate the original point process
n <- 3
l <- 150
m <- rpois(n, l)
x <- list()
for(i in 1:n)
    x[[i]] <- rnorm(m[i], mean = 1 / 2, sd = .15)
# Simulate the warp maps
warp <- rwarp(n)
# Get the warped point process
xw <- list()
for(i in 1:n)
    xw[[i]] <- warp$T(x[[i]],i)
```
Thus, `xw` is our multiple point process in a list form. Next, we need to set the prior and mcmc parameters; following the same specifications as in Galasso et al (2022), here we consider:  
```
mcmc <- list(nburn = 500, nsave = 4500, nskip = 0, ndisplay = 100)
prior <- list(aa0 = 2, ab0 = 2, kmax = 1000, a0 = 1, b0 = 1)
```
Finally, we need to define if we can run this in parallel or not. By default, our algorithm runs using `#cores - 1` (`parallel = TRUE`); if  `parallel = FALSE`, then our algorithm runs in a single-core.
To run our method, you need just execute the following command:
```
fit <- bmpp(xw = xw, prior = prior, mcmc = mcmc)
```
The output was stored in the object `fit` which has as output the estimated warp maps and registered point processes, among other.

To visualize the output, you may use the `plot` function which has a specific parameter `type` when the object to plot is of the class `bmpp`; the following options can be used to obtain different targets (respectively FrÃ©chet mean, distribution function, warp maps, and multiple point process):
```
plot(fit, type = 'fmean')
plot(fit, type = 'cdf')       ## try also: plot(fit, type = 'cdf', choose = 1)
plot(fit, type = 'warp')      ## try also: plot(fit, type = 'warp', choose = 1)
plot(fit, type = 'mpp')       ## try also: plot(fit, type = 'mpp', choose = 1)
```
